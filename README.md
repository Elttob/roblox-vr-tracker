## Why track VR issues here?
Roblox VR is notoriously undermaintained - there are a lot of common pitfalls and gotchas which can be hard to navigate as a newer developer. This repository aims to document all of these pitfalls to help you learn and work around the many issues of Roblox VR, such as broken bindings, core UI quirks, and instances which don't function, render correctly, or crash your game.

## How to use
In this repository, bugs are documented using issues. Check out the 'Issues' tab to browse through them.
If you encounter a bug, quirk, or undocumented behaviour that isn't tracked here, feel free to open a new issue.

Some examples of good issues:
- Controller bindings broken for Valve Index
- Clouds do not render correctly
- SurfaceGuis crash client on interaction
- "VRLaserPointerMode" undocumented SetCore
